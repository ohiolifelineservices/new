const FAQS = [
  { question: "How do I check if Metronet is available at my address?", answer: "Enter your zip code in the checker on this page. Because fiber is built street by street, final serviceability is confirmed against your exact street address during the ordering process." },
  { question: "My neighbor has Metronet but the checker says my area isn't served. Why?", answer: "Fiber construction happens block by block, so two addresses on the same street can have different answers. If your zip is in an active market but your address isn't serviceable yet, joining the waitlist is the fastest way to hear when it changes." },
  { question: "What happens if Metronet isn't available where I live?", answer: "You can join the waitlist with your address details. There's no cost and no obligation — it simply flags your area." },
  { question: "Does checking availability commit me to anything?", answer: "No. Checking availability is free and does not start an order." },
  { question: "How long does installation take once I order?", answer: "You choose a preferred install date and time window during ordering, and a confirmation follows by email." },

                How Metronet fiber availability actually works
              </h2>
              <p>
                Fiber internet coverage is not a switch that flips on for a whole city at once. Metronet builds its
                network out neighborhood by neighborhood, and sometimes street by street within a neighborhood. That is
                why a zip code check tells you whether your <em>area</em> is inside a served market, while your exact
                street address determines whether service can be installed today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Practically, there are three outcomes when you check. Your address is serviceable and you can order
                immediately. Your area is an active Metronet market but construction hasn&apos;t reached your block —
                joining the waitlist is the right move. Or Metronet hasn&apos;t built in your area at all yet, in which
                case the waitlist still records the demand.
              </p>

              <h3>Why address-level confirmation matters</h3>
              <p>
                An install requires a physical fiber drop from the street to the home. Multi-dwelling units,
                new-construction subdivisions, and rural edges of a market are the most common cases where a zip code
                looks covered but an individual address needs verification. Confirming at the address level up front
                avoids a cancelled install date later.
              </p>

              <h3>What to have ready when you order</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Your full service address, including unit or apartment number</li>
                <li>A contact email and phone number for install confirmation</li>
                <li>A preferred install date and time window</li>
                <li>The speed you want — see <Link href="/plans-pricing">plans and pricing</Link></li>
              </ul>

              <h3>If Metronet isn&apos;t available yet</h3>
              <p>
                Join the waitlist. It costs nothing, does not create an order, and is the most direct way to be
                contacted when fiber reaches your area. In the meantime, you can browse{" "}
