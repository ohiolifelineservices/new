  { question: "How much does Metronet internet cost per month?", answer: "Current Metronet residential pricing through Metroconet is $60/mo for 500 Mbps, $70/mo for 1 Gig, and $80/mo for 2 Gig, all with AutoPay enrollment. First Month Free is available for eligible new customers." },
  { question: "What's the difference between 500 Mbps, 1 Gig, and 2 Gig?", answer: "All three run on the same 100% fiber network with symmetrical upload and download speeds. The difference is total bandwidth: 500 Mbps suits light households, 1 Gig is the mainstream choice for most homes, and 2 Gig is best for power users and large households that want extra headroom." },
  { question: "Is 2 Gig worth the extra cost over 1 Gig?", answer: "2 Gig is only $10/month more than 1 Gig. If your household runs many simultaneous devices, does large uploads, or wants maximum future headroom, it's an easy upgrade. If you mostly stream and browse, 1 Gig is plenty." },
  { question: "Does AutoPay change my price?", answer: "Listed pricing requires AutoPay enrollment. If you'd prefer not to use AutoPay, ask about pricing without it when you place your order." },
  { question: "Are there data caps or overage fees?", answer: "No. Every current Metronet plan includes unlimited data with no caps, no throttling, and no overage charges." },
  { question: "Is there a contract or early termination fee?", answer: "No annual contract is required on any current Metronet residential plan." },
  { question: "Is equipment included?", answer: "A fiber gateway/router is included with installation so your home is Wi-Fi ready from day one." },
  { question: "Can I change plans later?", answer: "Yes. Because there's no annual contract, you can move between speed tiers as your household needs change." },
  { question: "How do I know which plan is right for my home?", answer: "Count simultaneous heavy users, not devices. One or two light users do fine on 500 Mbps. Three or more people streaming, gaming, and working at once are best served by 1 Gig. Households with heavy uploads, a home business, or a large smart-home setup should look at 2 Gig." },
  { question: "How do I order?", answer: "Choose a plan on this page, click through to the order form, enter your service address, and pick a preferred install date and time window. A confirmation follows by email." },

                What you should know before ordering Metronet fiber
              </h2>
              <p>
                Metronet pricing is refreshingly simple compared to most internet providers: three speed tiers, a flat
                monthly rate with AutoPay, no data caps, and no annual contract on any plan. There is no complicated
                bundle math and no promotional rate that quietly triples in month thirteen of a two-year agreement.
              </p>

              <h3>Symmetrical speeds are the real product</h3>
              <p>
                Every plan on this page gives you the same upload speed as download speed. On cable internet, a
                &ldquo;gigabit&rdquo; plan typically ships with an upload speed somewhere between 20 and 50 Mbps. That
                gap is why video calls compress, cloud backups crawl, and large file uploads take an afternoon. With
                Metronet fiber, <strong>1 Gig down means 1 Gig up</strong>, and that changes the day-to-day experience
                far more than the headline download number does.
              </p>

              <h3>Equipment and installation</h3>
              <p>
                A fiber gateway/router is included with installation, so your home is Wi-Fi ready from day one. When you
                order, you choose a preferred install date and time window, and a confirmation follows by email. A
                technician brings the fiber line into the home, installs the gateway, and gets your network live.
              </p>

              <h3>Billing, contracts, and changing plans</h3>
              <p>
                Listed pricing requires AutoPay enrollment. No annual contract is required, which also means there is no
                early termination fee tying you to a speed tier. If your household grows into more bandwidth — a new
                remote job, a gaming teenager, a smart-home build-out — you can move up without renegotiating a contract.
              </p>

              <h3>Availability comes before pricing</h3>
              <p>
                Fiber is built street by street, so the first question is always whether Metronet has reached your
                address. Use the <Link href="/check-availability">availability checker</Link> before you get attached to
                a plan, or browse <Link href="/metronet-state">service areas by state</Link> to see the markets where
                Metronet fiber is live today.
              </p>

              <h3>The current offer</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>First Month Free</strong> applies to eligible new customers on all three speeds. Offer
                availability and eligibility may vary by service address and are confirmed during ordering. See the{" "}
